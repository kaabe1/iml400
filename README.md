“A Home: Not Paradise” is an experience-based installation that simulates a flight to Hawaiʻi. Through the flight, the audience has opportunity to understand issues of colonialism, militarism & environmentalism through the lens of tourism. The experience is built to subvert the propagated image of “paradise” and understand the day-to-day issues that impact the local and Kānak Maolī (Native Hawaiian) community.

## About

This webpage was created to provide the auidnece to naviagte project details and house the "in-flight epxiernece" portion of the installation. When exploring the "virtual experience" portion of the website, the audince is able to further understand the history of tourism through interacrtive elements, which is an omen to reimagining the design of flight experiences. Additionally this virtual expeience page allowed me to be experimental and explore fun ways to emulate such a physcial experience.
